# Python automation for Cisco Unified CM configuration

These scripts allow to automate configuration of a Cisco Unified CM setup in line with the 
best practices layed out in the 
["Preferred Architecture for Cisco Collaboration 12.x Enterprise On-Premises Deployments, CVD"](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Collaboration/enterprise/12x/120/collbcvd.html).
Especially all configuration guidance documented in the Call Control chapter can be configured using 
the `setup.py` script provided.

The configuration is driven by a `config_{*}.yml` file. An example is given in `config_example.yml`.
